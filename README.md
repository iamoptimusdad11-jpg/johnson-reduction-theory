# Johnson Reduction Theory  
*A structural approach to understanding, simplifying, and analyzing complex systems.*

Johnson Reduction Theory is an exploratory framework focused on reducing large or chaotic systems into smaller, understandable, and actionable components. The project includes early documentation and conceptual models describing how high-dimensional patterns, repeating structures, and emergent behaviors can be simplified into more usable forms.

This repository includes early notes, experimental ideas, and working drafts—such as **quantum_numerology.html**—all centered on one goal:  
**help people understand the hidden order within seemingly complicated systems.**
