Johnson Reduction Visualizer

A metaphysical–mathematical interactive visualizer exploring the Johnson Reduction Theory, infinity modes, master-number numerology, and geometric energetic states up to 100.

This tool transforms any number into:

- A Johnson Reduction Value
- A Numerology Reduction Value
- A Geometric Shape matching the number’s properties
- A Spin Rate tied to the number’s energetic intensity
- A Metaphysical Description explaining meaning + behavior
- A Dynamic Visualization, including superposition behavior for 1 and glowing polygons for large numbers

🌌 Core Concepts

Johnson Reduction Theory

The theory follows the rules:

- 0 = 1
- 19 = 10 when aleph-null equals ashtei-asar-null
- 10 = 1
- 1 = 1
When infinite-compression mode is disabled, numbers remain untouched.

Two reduction paths exist:

1. Johnson Mode (non-numerological, infinity-dependent)
2. Numerology Mode (classic digit reduction, respecting master numbers)

The system allows toggling between:

- Closed Infinity Mode (aleph-null ≠ ashtei-asar-null)
- Open Infinity Mode (aleph-null = ashtei-asar-null)

Each mode affects how numbers reduce.

🎨 Geometric Visualization System

Number 1 — Superposition Dot

- Acts chaotically
- Changes color rapidly
- Teleports, jitters, and creates quantum-style echoes
- Mimics a probability cloud collapsing repeatedly

Number 2–100 — Polygon Generator

- Number determines number of sides
- Higher numbers spin faster
- Master Number 11 doubles its spin speed
- High-sided shapes glow, pulse, and display more visibly
- Colors shift based on number energy

🧠 Infinity Mode Effects

Open Infinity Mode

- Aleph-null = ashtei-asar-null
- 19 reduces to 10
- High numbers behave more “compressed”

Closed Infinity Mode

- No reduction beyond the standard rules
- Numbers reveal their raw geometries

This duality lets users explore metaphysical behavior across infinite frameworks.
